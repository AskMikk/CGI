## About the procces

I had no experience with AngularJS before, but I have been working little bit with React. I decided to try something new and still chose AngularJS. Therefore, before starting to write code, I needed to spend time learning this framework.

The most difficult part of the development was creating a form to send a new checkout to the database, as there were a lot of pitfalls there. There were also a problems with paging, as the standard methods found during the search did'nt give the desired result.

## Functionality

- [x] Using backend api endpoint /getBooks, implement table of books view
- [x] Using backend api endpoint /getCheckouts, also implement the checkouts view. Suppport paging and sorting for both views
- [x] Implement individual book and checkout view, support basic CRUD operations, implement checking out and returning books
- [x] Implement searching for books using freetext criteria
- [x] Implement filtering for books by status
- [x] Implement saving / displaying favorite books for current user (you can use localStorage if you don't want to make back-end changes)
- [x] Add modal confirmation dialogues when deleting or checking out books
- [x] Implement a user-friendly way to display late checkouts
